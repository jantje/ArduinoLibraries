/*
 * This is a example sketch showing the use of EEPROM to save values
 *
 * This example sketch needs quite some libraries as you can see below with the includes
 * Make sure they are configured and linked to properly
 *
 * This example is a follow up of SerialCommunicatorStep3 which is bundled as an example in
 *  the SerialCommunicator library
 *
 *  This example is slightly different from the previous in code and allows saving values in
 *  EEPROM
 *
 *  In the previous example we could change the blink rhythm of the led on pin 13
 *  and the logging parameters but each time the Arduino is reset these object values
 *  are lost.
 *  In this example we will add a the possibility to save the object values that are
 *  tagged as possible to save.
 *
 *
 *  verify and upload the code; connect with the serial monitor and send following
 *  lines to the Arduino (do not forget to add a CR or LF or both)
 *  ?
 *  ->note that a SAVE and LOAD have been added
 *  SET Admin.DelaybetweenLogs=5000
 *  -> reboot the arduino
 *  SET
 *  -> Admin.DelaybetweenLogs is set to the default value (probably garbage)
 *   *  SET Admin.DelaybetweenLogs=5000
 *  SAVE
 *  -> reboot the arduino
 *  SET
 *  -> Admin.DelaybetweenLogs is still set on 5000
 *  SET Admin.DelaybetweenLogs=800
 *  LOAD
 *  -> Admin.DelaybetweenLogs is reset to 5000
